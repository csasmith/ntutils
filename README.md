# TODO

- make note that `num` crate already has functions for gcd, lcm, extended
gcd and that those are almost undoubtedly at least as good as these. 

- add tests for rest of functions

- add command for BÃ©zout coefficients / modular inverse. Can finish quickly
with wrapper for num extended gcd, but would also appreciate writing my own.

- move TODOs from main.rs and elsewhere to here
